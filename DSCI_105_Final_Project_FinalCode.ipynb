    "   Using the selenium package, we went through each university link from the usnews top national universities (US). Selenium would gather the entire pages html, which we then used to scrape data from. Our biggest issue was the styling of the pages. USnews requires users to scroll towards the bottom of the page for more of it to load, this is why Selenium was vital to the project as it was able to bypass this feature and get the whole script. \n",
    "   \n",
    "  Web scraping was broken into two sections. A heavy portion was in one class, and we used an indexing approach to gather the data. However, the remaining were in their own classes. Both situations took advantage of varying string manipulations, such as ‘.text’, ‘.replace’, and ‘.strip’. We did come across an issue with public schools. Since Selenium was slow, we had been using a sample test list. This test list was only private schools. Once we realized that public schools also had ’in-state’ and ‘out-of-state’ tuition, we had to adjust our code to include this.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Some data manipulation was the adding of longitude and latitude coordinates via the geocode package. We separated each school address and using only the zipcode, geocode was able to return the longitude and latitude of the location. This allowed for mapping opportunities in Tableau. We utilized ‘if-else’ statements to leave objects blank when there was no data for a specific school. This allowed us to use Tableau’s remove NA feature during analysis. This was crucial for the ethnicity rankings per school. Many schools near the bottom of the list only had a few ethnicity groups, rather than seven (the average). There were also a lot of testing code along the way to ensure the code is running properly, such as checking if the university was already completed or not. "

    "Our findings helped give a broad picture to the best schools in the US. We were able to look into the best and worst of many factors, such as, acceptance rate, SAT/ACT scores, tuition, costs after financial aid, schools per state, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, University of South Dakota had a 99% acceptance rate. California Institute of Technology and Harvard both had the lowest acceptance rate at 3%. Schools were pretty evenly split between public and private schools, with 158 public and 139 private. We found a spatial pattern, the US seems to be split down the middle with most schools scattered on the eastern half. This is likely due to population spacing, there are too many people living in the Dakotas. \n",
    "\n",
    "We think that this is a useful project because it helps bring visuals and straightforward answers to high school students looking into higher education. Going through sites such as niche, USnews, PrincetonReview, etc. can be very challenging. It typically leads to a student opening 50 tabs and trying to remember which school had the best earnings after graduation, or writing down notes to compare by hand, both of which are not ideal. Our code breaks this difficulty down, allowing students to filter a list of their chosen schools and analyze every factor that the USnews site has to offer, except a few. For instance, a future addition to this project could be adding the schools best majors, adding more of the bibliometric/research stats, and the short bio on dorm options. A huge addition could also be taking the top 300 schools from several different ranking sites (PrincetonReview, Niche, Forbes). Another cool option would be putting this into our own website, after checking the legality of that of course."

    "There are a few things that must be considered when reviewing our analysis. Most importantly, all of our data comes from USnews. As many people know, there are several sites that rank schools and each has their own ranking system. Each list is biased for many reasons, but ours is entirely biased to USnews' ranking system. Besides only getting USnews data. The data may not be entirely accurate. The list is updated to 2024, but we don’t know if each schools’ inputs are. For instance, some schools were missing average SAT scores and high school GPAs, but it is possible that we could find this information on other sites. Missing data also made it difficult to compare some of the schools on the list. "
